### For our course, we don't talk about optimization and code

#### Grading Criteria

1. Design a simple compiler for Micro language (2/23 HW#1, Due: 3/10)
2. Design a scanner for Micro language (3/11 HW#2, Due: 3/29)
3. Design a parser for Micro language (3/30 HW#3, Due: 4/14)
4. Design a simplified C Compiler (4/15 HW#4, Due: 5/5)

#### Analysis and synthesis 

The analysis part breaks up the source program into constituent pieces and creates an `intermediate representation` of the source program. The synthesis part constructs the desired target program from the intermediate representation

Once we have the tokens we put them into a parser and generate the syntax tree.  e.g

`If else block`

```c
int main(){
    int x = 3;
    if (x < 4):{
        
    }else{
        
    }
    
}
```

When parser reads token "if"

We put the corresponding part into the tree, which are: 

* Condition: The things in the "()" after "if"
* If Block: Things in the "{}" after ":"
* Else Block: Things in the  "{}" after "else"
* END IF: Things that are after else

Transfer them into existed assembly language:

Compare

`Conditional jungle`to Else block

If block 

`jungle`to END IF

`Else`Block

`END IF`

Now try to write the process for while loop and functions (OvO)



`While Loop Block`

```c
int main(){
    int x = 10;
    while (x >= 1){
        block;
        x -= 1;  
    }
}
```

Read while and decompose:

* Condition: Things is () after "while"

* While Block: Things is the {} after ()

* END WHILE: Things after While Block

But how to actualize While Block, it still needs condition if:

`Condition if `to test the condition

Jungle `END WHILE`

while block

jungle `Condition if `

`END WHILE`



`Function Block`

```c
int Func(){
    
}  
int maiN(){
    
    func()
    
}
```

Once read the func() 

Leave a flag and jungle to the function definition with parameter.

Call `symbol and attribute table`of that function

At the end of the function, there is a ret, which means delete the memory built for this function

Also get back to the flag.
